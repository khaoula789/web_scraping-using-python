# web_scraping-using-python
Web scraping is the extraction of data such as images, user reviews, or product descriptions from web pages.Many times, we don't have pre-established data to start our analysis. In this case, we should be able to find and scrape our own data. 
In this project, we will use python to collect data from the Github site and store the data at the end on csv files.
